## Community Support Plan
Sesameseed seeks to fairly distribute the rewards of the Nodes it operates.

In keeping with our core beliefs, a simple 80–10–10 model will be observed.

· 80% of all rewards will be distributed to the Sesameseed community in proportion to all votes cast.

· 10% of all rewards generated by Sesameseed shall be retained by Sesameseed. The use of these rewards will be determined by the community on the first of every month by a 1 vote per active member voting structure.

· 10% of all rewards shall be retained by Sesameseed for use as operating expenses.

Total operating expenses and member rewards shall be made available to the community in a completely transparent and consistent manner.

## Tokenization of Sesameseed Distribution
The above-mentioned rewards to the Sesameseed community shall be distributed in the form of Sesameseed tokens aka “Sesameseeds” or “Seeds”.

## Voting Model
Monthly voting shall be conducted by Sesameseed on its website, on the following three topics:

· Use of retained funds (10% of monthly rewards) (e.g. Community reward’s, App Developer fund, additional nodes, etc.)

· Stance of Sesameseed community with respect to Tron Foundation (political position, opinion of Tron Network performance, direction of Tron Foundation, partnerships, etc.)

· Polling of Sesameseed’s performance.

Potential topics for voting shall be gathered by general community discussion (social media) as well as formal submission through the website. A topic and voting list shall be available to the community throughout the current month.
